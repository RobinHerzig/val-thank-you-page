The goal for this client was to improve user accessibility by creating a membership form, plus a thank you page to display after submitting.

## How It's Made:

The form is an HTML document containing inline styling to ensure it matches the rest of the page. Because we don't have access to the backend, I used formsubmit.co to route the responses to the provided email address.

## Optimizations:

While improving accessibility should be a fairly straight-forward process, GoDaddy limits access to backend and requires workarounds for certain features. This added challenges and forced me to think outside the box to implement solutions.

## Installation:

The site administrator may copy and paste all the code from form.html into the appropriate custom HTML section.
